## Getting and Plotting Earth Magnetometer data.
The notebook [Getting_Magnetometer_Data](Getting_Magnetometer_Data.ipynb) can be used to retrieve and visualise magnetometer data. Since it is all written as a jupyter notebook, the client can easily perform any other analysis of the data they wish.

### Requirements:
* Python 3 (Anaconda Python 3 recommended)
* A [Magnetometer_data_server]() to get data from


### Required python libraries:
* Jupyter
* requests
* pandas
* io
* matplotlib
* IPython

Note: the URL's in the notebooks are set to `http://localhost:5000`. This needs changing to the URL of the magnetometer server.
